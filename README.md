# Calculator made with JavaScript

Small project i did when i started learning JavaScript.


Simple web calculator. It includes the normal arithmetic operations that you can find in a
calculator as well as a series of operations that i named "comma operations"
such as sorting numbers, changing number index on the sequence, removing the
last number added, as well as an addition of all the numbers in the sequence and displayed
on the screen.

To use the comma operations first you have to introduce a number, and after that you need to press the comma button in the calculator **,** .
You can introduce all the numbers you want but you'll have to separate all of them with commas.

**The comma operations remain disabled until you press the comma button**
